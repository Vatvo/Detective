# Detective
Game for GAM-1000

Detective is my project for GAM-1000. The game is centered around mysteries randomly assemled from prewritten locations, characters, and clues.
My goal is for the game to be as highly moddable as possible, with new game elements being easily added. Every file is written in C++, so it can
run on pretty much anything.
